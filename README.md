# feedback-system
This is a simple Feedback Form built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It allows users to enter their name, email, rating, and feedback message, and shows a success confirmation when submitted.  The project is frontend-only, meaning no server or database is required. It is lightweight, responsive, and easy to customize for any website.
